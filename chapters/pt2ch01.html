<h2><a name="pt2ch1-MaximumLikelihoodEstimate"></a>Maximum Likelihood Estimate</h2>
        <p>Suresh tosses a coin 1000 times and he observes heads 400 times.</p>

<p>This is a stochastic process that takes discrete values viz. heads (1) or tails 
(0). In such cases, we can calculate the probability of observing a particular 
set of outcomes by making suitable assumptions about the underlying stochastic 
process. For example, in our case, probability of coin landing heads is \(p\) 
and that coin tosses are independent.</p>

<p>Let’s denote the observed outcomes by \(O\) and the set of parameters that 
describe the stochastic process as \(\theta\). Our observed outcome is 400 
heads and 600 tails. The process of tossing a coin is governed only by the 
probability \(p\). Hence, \(\theta = p\). Thus, when we speak of probability 
we want to calculate \(P(O \mid \theta)\). In other words, given specific 
values for \(\theta\), \(P(O \mid \theta)\) is the probability that we would 
observe the outcomes represented by \(O\).</p>

<p>However, when we model a real life stochastic process, we often do not know 
\(\theta\). We simply observe \(O\) and the goal then is to arrive at an 
estimate for \(\theta\) that would be a plausible choice given the observed 
outcomes \(O\). We know that given a value of \(\theta\) the probability of 
observing \(O\) is \(P(O \mid \theta)\). Thus, a ‘natural’ estimation process 
is to choose that value of \(\theta\) that would maximize the probability that 
we would actually observe \(O\). In other words, we find the parameter values 
\(\theta\) that maximize the following function:</p>

\[L(\theta \mid O) = P(O \mid \theta)\]

<p>\(L(\theta \mid O)\) is called the likelihood function. Notice that by 
definition the likelihood function is conditioned on the observed \(O\) and 
that it is a function of the unknown parameters \(\theta\).</p>

<p>Suresh is about to toss the coin again and he would like to know the 
probability of getting a heads in this toss. We can estimate the probability 
of observing heads as</p>

\[P(Heads) = \frac{400}{1000} = 0.4 = \hat{\theta}_{\tiny{MLE}}\]

<p>However, it is important to note that we do not know the exact probability of 
getting the heads \(\theta\). \(\hat{\theta}_{\tiny{MLE}}\) is an estimate 
that maximises the likelihood of observing the outcomes that we already saw. 
In other words, it the value of the parameter which is the most reasonable 
explantion for our observations.</p>

<p>It’s all good for argument sake, but can we prove this theoritically?</p>

<p>We know that tossing a coin 1000 times is a Bernouli trial and the number of 
heads (denoted by random variable \(X\)) follows a Binomial distribution. 
Let’s assume that \(\theta\) is the probablity of getting a head in any single 
coin toss. Thus, probability of getting a tails in single toss will be 
\((1-\theta)\). Hence, the probability of getting \(k\) heads in \(n\) coin 
tosses is given by</p>

\[P(X = k \mid \theta) = {}^{n}C_{k} \; \theta^{k}(1-\theta)^{n-k}\]

<p>where</p>

<p>Now, we can formulate our maximum likelihood estimate as</p>

\[\begin{align}
\hat{\theta}_{\tiny{MLE}} &amp;= \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}} L(\theta \mid X = k)\\
&amp;=  \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}} P(X = k \mid \theta)\\
&amp;=  \underset{\theta \in [0,1]}{\operatorname{argmax}} {}^{n}C_{k} \; \theta^{k}(1-\theta)^{n-k}
\end{align}\]

<p>Instead of maximizing the likelihood, we will maximise the log of likelihood. 
Since log is a monotonically increasing function, it preserves the location of 
maximas and minimas of the original function</p>

\[\begin{align}
LL(\theta \mid X = k) &amp;= \log (L(\theta \mid X = k))\\
&amp;= \log ({}^{n}C_{k} \; \theta^{k}(1-\theta)^{n-k})\\
&amp;= \log ({}^{n}C_{k}) + k \log(\theta) + (n-k) \log(1-\theta)
\end{align}\]

<p>Therefore,</p>

\[\begin{align}
\hat{\theta}_{\tiny{MLE}} &amp;= \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}} L(\theta \mid X = k)\\
&amp;=  \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}} LL(\theta \mid X = k)\\
&amp;=  \underset{\theta \in [0,1]}{\operatorname{argmax}} \log ({}^{n}C_{k}) + k \log(\theta) + (n-k) \log(1-\theta)
\end{align}\]

<p>Differentiating with respect to \(\theta\),</p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{d}{d \theta} LL(\theta \mid X = k) &amp;= \frac{d}{d \theta} \log ({}^{n}C_{k}) + k \frac{d}{d \theta} \log(\theta) + (n-k) \frac{d}{d \theta} \log(1-\theta)\\
&amp;= \frac{k}{\theta} - \frac{n-k}{1-\theta}
\end{align}\]

<p>For \(\theta\) to be maximum,</p>

\[\frac{d}{d \theta} LL(\theta \mid X = k) = 0\\
\frac{k}{\theta} - \frac{n-k}{1-\theta} = 0\\
\frac{k}{\theta} = \frac{n-k}{1-\theta}\\
\theta = \frac{k}{n}\]

<p>Thus, the maximum likelihood estimator for \(\theta\) is</p>

\[\hat{\theta}_{\tiny{MLE}} = \frac{k}{n}\]

<p>This is the same estimate which we calculated initially i.e. \(\hat{\theta}_{\tiny{MLE}} = \frac{400}{1000} = 0.4\)</p>

<h3 id="continuous-random-variables">Continuous Random Variables</h3>

<p>If the stochatistc process has a continous random variable as its outcome, 
then the situation is similar, with one important difference. We can no longer 
talk about the probability that we observed \(O\) given \(\theta\) because in 
the continuous case \(P(O \mid \theta)=0\). Without getting into 
technicalities, the basic idea is as follows:</p>

<p>Denote the probability density function (pdf) associated with the outcomes 
\(O\) as: \(f(O \mid \theta)\). Thus, in the continuous case we estimate 
\(\theta\) given observed outcomes \(O\) by maximizing the following function:</p>

\[L(\theta \mid O)=f(O \mid \theta)\]

<p>Our use of the pdf instead of actual probability intutuively makes sense 
because if we compare probabilities of getting a small set of outcome e.g. 
\(P(300 \leq O \leq 301 \mid \theta)\) instead of a particular outcome e.g. 
\(P(O = 300 \mid \theta)\), then we can see that the probabilities are 
actually proportional to the value of pdf 
\(f((O_{max} + O_{min})/2 \mid \theta)\).</p>

<p>In this situation, we cannot technically assert that we are finding the 
parameter value that maximizes the probability that we observe \(O\) as we 
maximize the PDF associated with the observed outcomes \(O\).</p>

<h3 id="derivation-of-mle">Derivation of MLE</h3>
<p>Suppose we observe \(n\) samples. Let each sample be denoted by random 
variables \(X_i\), \(X_2\), …, \(X_n\). Its safe to assume that \(X_i\)’s 
are independent of each other i.e drawing a sample from the population does 
not affect the chances of getting any other sample. Each random variable is 
governed by a distribution which follows the probability mass function (in 
discrete random variables) or probability density function (in case of 
continous random variabes) \(f_{\theta}(x_i) = f(x_i \mid \theta)\). This 
means that the distribution is governed by a parameter \(\theta\). Such 
random variables are said to be independent and identically distributed 
(i.i.d).</p>

<p>Now, if we observe that \(X_i = x_i\), \(X_2 = x_2\), …, \(X_n = x_n\). 
Then, the probability of making this observation is given by a function 
\(f_{\thata}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\). This is known as joint probability mass 
function (for discrete random variables) and probability mass function (for 
continous random variables). It is given as</p>

\[\begin{align}
f_{\theta}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) &amp;= f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \mid \theta)\\
&amp;= \prod^{i=1}{n} f_{theta}(x_i)\\
\end{align}\]

<p>The likelihood function of \(\theta\) is given by</p>

\[\begin{align}
L(\theta \mid \mathcal{D}) &amp;= L(\theta \mid x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\\
&amp;= f_{\theta}(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)\\
&amp;= f(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n \mid \theta)\\
&amp;= \prod^{i=1}{n} f_{theta}(x_i)
\end{align}\]

<p>Thus the maximum likihood extimator of \(\theta\) is given by</p>

\[\begin{align}
\hat{\theta}_{\tiny{MLE}} = \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}} L(\theta \mid \mathcal{D})\\
&amp;= \underset{\theta}{\operatorname{argmax}} \prod^{i=1}{n} f_{theta}(x_i)
\end{align}\]
<h2><a name="pt2ch1-Entropy"></a>Entropy</h2>
        <p>The entropy of a random variable is measure of its uncertainity. Some texts 
also refer it as a measure of information content.</p>

<p>But, what is the meaning of uncertainity or information content? Let’s 
understand with an example
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/entropy_example.svg" alt="Entropy example" width="80%" height="80%" />
We have two random alphabet generator machines which generate one character 
from the set \(\{A, B, C, D\}\). The probabilities of generating each alphabet 
is, however, different for both machines. For machine 1, each alphabet is 
equaly likely to be generated i.e. \(P(A) = P(B) = P(C) = P(D) = \frac{1}{4}\). 
However, for machine 2, probabilities of getting each alphabet is 
\(P(A) = \frac{1}{2}\), \(P(B) = \frac{1}{4}\), \(P(C) = \frac{1}{8}\) and 
\(P(D) = \frac{1}{8}\).</p>

<p>But, you cannot directly generate a alphabet from these machines. As it turns 
out, these machines have overly complicated controls for a seemingly simple 
task. Hence, there is a machine operator who can get the machine to generate a 
alphabet for you. Machine operator generates an alphabet from the machine but 
insists that you guess the alphabet correctly by asking some questions only 
then would he give the alphabet to you. Given the absurd situation you have 
found yourselves in, you would like to get over with it by asking minimum 
number of questions to the operator.</p>

<p>Consider the case where you ask operator to generate an aplhabet from machine 
1.
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/entropy_machine1.svg" alt="Questions machine 1" width="50%" height="50%" />
You ask the first question to operator, “Is the alphabet A or B?”. The 
operator says yes. Then you ask, “Is the alphabet A?”. The operator respond 
no. Hence, you tell the operator that the machine generated the alphabet B. 
The operator then hands it over to you.</p>

<p>Please note that to guess the alphabet correctly, you had to ask two 
questions. From the decision tree in the above image, you can see that even if 
the operator responded differently for any of the questions, you would still 
need to ask two questions. Thus, if you repeat this experiment for 100 times, 
you would need to ask 200 questions i.e. on an average 2 questions per trial.</p>

<p>Let’s see what happens for machine 2. Since, probability of getting A is 
highest, you should start asking questions from A and then move to alphabets 
with lower probability of occurrence. This will ensure that if you repeat the 
trial sevel times, you will be asking minimum number of question.
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/entropy_machine2.svg" alt="Questions machine 2" width="50%" height="50%" />
You ask the operator to get a new alphabet from the machine and start with a 
question “Is the alphabet A?”. The operator responds with a no. Then, you ask, 
“Is the alphabet B?”. The operator says yes. The operator hands the alphabet 
over to you as you guessed it correctly.</p>

<p>Note that you had to ask two questions to correctly guess the alphabet B. 
However, you can see that in the decision tree, you would need to ask just one 
question if the alphabet generated by the machine 2 was A. Similarly, you 
would need to ask three questions to correctly guess C or D.</p>

<p>If you repeat this experiment 800 times, you can expect to see 400 A’s, 200 
B’s, 100 C’s and 100 D’s. Thus the average number of questions that you would 
need to ask is 
\(\frac{400 \cdot 1 + 200 \cdot 2 + 100 \cdot 3 + 100 \cdot 3}{800} = 1.75\).</p>

<p>The more uncertain the outcome of an experiment is, more number of questions 
you would ask to guess the outcome correctly. Thus the average number of 
questions you ask is the measure of uncertainity. This can also be termed as 
information content. If the probability of occurence of an event is \(p\) then 
you would more or less (not exactly always) be asking \(-\log_{2}(p)\) 
questions. So, the average number of questions that you would be asking is 
entropy.</p>

<p>Given a discrete random variable \(X\), with possible outcomes \(x_1\), …, 
\(x_n\), which occur with probability \(P(x_1)\), …, \(P(x_n)\), the entropy 
of \(X\) is formally defined as:</p>

\[H(X) = - \sum_{i=1}^{n} P(x_i) \log_{2}(P(x_i))\]

<p>Of all the distributions with variance \(\sigma^2\), Gaussian distribution has 
the highest entropy. It models the highest uncertainity. Hence, it usually 
chosen to model unknown random variables as it encapsulates the worst case 
scenario of maximum uncertainity. This is the reason we chose 
\(\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\) to model the error \(\varepsilon\).</p>
