  <h1 class="page-title">Chapter 10: Linear Regression</h1>
</header>
<div class="content">
  <p>Linear regression is concerned with modelling the relationship between 
dependent variable and independent variable.</p>

<p>Suppose a company would like to know how much it should spend on the 
commercials to achieve a certain amount of sales. It has the data regarding 
their previous investments for commercials and the resultant sales figures. To 
get a somewhat accurate estimate, the analysts in the company would like to 
understand the reationship between the sales and the investments into the TV 
commercials.</p>

<p>Let’s establish the following notation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The amount invested into the TV commercials is denoted by \(x\) because it 
is the independent variable here.</li>
  <li>The sales figure during this period is denoted by \(y\) because it is the 
dependent variable.</li>
  <li>The company has data in form of n pairs like \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(i\) is 
the index.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s visualize the data via a scatter plot
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/linear-regression1.png" alt="Scatter Plot: Sales vs TV" />
We can clearly see a linear trend in this plot. If spending on TV commercials 
increases the sales figures seem to increase.</p>

<p>We describe a general linear relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) via the 
following equation:</p>

\[y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x\]

<p>If we fit the this curve to the data, we get the following line:</p>

\[y = 6.9748 + 0.0554x\]

<p>Let’s plot this line on our data
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/linear-regression2.png" alt="Linear Regression Fit" />
We can see that the line passes more or less through the middle of the data 
points.</p>

<p>In this example, we had just one value as input i.e. the \(x\) was scalar. 
However, there might be seveal factors which influence the sales figures like</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time of investment</li>
  <li>Time of commercial</li>
  <li>Expenditure on radio commercials</li>
  <li>Expenditure on newspaper commercials</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the \(x\) is not a scalar, but a collection of the above 
attributes. The following section will formalize the linear regression problem 
for such cases.</p>
<h2><a name="ch10-SimpleLinearRegression"></a>Simple Linear Regression</h2>
      <p>Suppose we have a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) which contains examples 
\(&lt;x_1, y_1&gt;\), \(&lt;x_2, y_2&gt;\), \(&lt;x_3, y_3&gt;\), … \(&lt;x_n, y_n&gt;\) where \(m\) 
is the total number of examples.</p>

<p>Each \(x\) is an input (also known as independent variable). And each \(y\) is 
output (also known as dependent or target variable).</p>

<p>\((x, y)\) represents a single example. \((x_i, y_i)\) is the \(j^{th}\) 
example where \(j\) is index to the dataset.</p>

<p>Each \(x_i\) has \(p\) attributes \(\phi_1(x_i)\), \(\phi_2(x_i)\), …, 
\(\phi_p(x_i)\). Then, we define a new \(n \times (p+1)\) matrix \(\phi\) as</p>

\[\phi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; \phi_1(x_1) &amp; \phi_2(x_1) &amp; ... &amp; \phi_p(x_1)\\
1 &amp; \phi_1(x_2) &amp; \phi_2(x_2) &amp; ... &amp; \phi_p(x_2)\\
.\\
.\\
.\\
1 &amp; \phi_1(x_n) &amp; \phi_2(x_n) &amp; ... &amp; \phi_p(x_n)\\
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Let’s also define a \(n \times 1\) matrix \(y\) as</p>

\[y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>The general equation of linear regression model is</p>

\[y_i = w_0 + w_1 \phi_1(x_i) + w_2 \phi_2(x_i) + ... + w_p \phi_p(x_i)\]

<p>where \(w_0\) is the bias and \(w_1\), \(w_2\), …, \(w_p\) are weights. We 
can denote this by a vector \(w\) as</p>

\[w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
w_0 \\
w_1 \\
w_2 \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
w_p
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Then the above equation in the matrix form can be written as</p>

\[y_i = w_1 ^ T \phi(x_i)\]

<p>where</p>

\[\phi(x_i) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
\phi_1(x_i) \\
\phi_2(x_i) \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
\phi_p(x_i)
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>The same equation can be written for all values of \(y\) as</p>

\[y = \phi(x) w\]

<p>The \(y\) is linear combination of columns of matrix \(\phi\) because 
\(i^th\) column of \(\phi\) is multiplied by \(w_i\). But this does not mean 
that linear regression is naievely linear. We can inject nonlinearities via 
the features/basis functions \(\phi_i\)s. For example, we could have used a 
function \(\phi(x_i) = x_i^2\) in the TV commercial example. To summarize, 
\(y\) is linear in \(\phi\) and \(w\) but it may or may not be linear with 
respect to \(x\).</p>

<h3 id="regression-problem">Regression Problem</h3>
<p>Now we define the regression problem as:</p>

<p>Determine a function \(f^*\) such that \(f^*(x)\) is the best predictor 
(minimizes the error \(E(f, \mathcal{D})\)) of \(y\) with respect to the data 
\(\mathcal{D}\).</p>

\[f^* = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F}}{\operatorname{argmin}} E(f, \mathcal{D})\]

<p>Here, \(f\) is a function which belongs to a class of functions 
\(\mathcal{F}\). For linear regression, \(\mathcal{F}\) is class of linear 
functions i.e. \(f\) is a linear function.</p>

<p>When we say best predictor, we must have a measure which we use to determine 
goodness of a function. The error function \(E\) is a measure of deviation of 
predicted value \(\hat{y}\) from the observed value \(y\). Smaller the error, 
better the predictior function \(f\). The error \(E\) is a function of \(f\) 
and data \(\mathcal{D}\). A common error function is Sum of Squared Error. 
There are different types of linear regression based on what error function is 
minimized and what classes of fuctions are considered.</p>

<h3 id="linear-regression-problem">Linear Regression Problem</h3>
<p>If we consider the class of linear functions for \(f\), then 
\(f(\phi(x), w) = \phi(x)w\). We can rewrite the above problem as:</p>

<p>Determine parameters \(w\) for the function \(f(\phi(x), w)\) which minimises 
the error function \(E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\).</p>

\[w^* = \underset{w}{\operatorname{argmin}} E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\]

<h3 id="sum-of-squared-error-sse">Sum of Squared Error (SSE)</h3>
<p>The sum of squares error is defined as follows:</p>

\[E(f, \mathcal{D}) = \sum_{\mathcal{D}}^{} (y_i - f(x_i))^2\]

<p>It measures the square of deviation of each example \((x_i, y_i)\) from the 
prediction \(\hat{y_i} = w^T \phi(x_i)\). Thus, it is a function of \(f\) and 
data \(\mathcal{D}\). This also known as Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).</p>

<p>This error is used to find a least square solution to linear regression 
problem.</p>
<h2><a name="ch10-LeastSquaresSolution"></a>Least Squares Solution</h2>
      <p><em>The following discussion relies on matrix calculus. If you are not comfortable 
with matrix calculus, you may want to take a look at 
<a href="https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/MatrixCalculus.pdf">this article</a> on the 
subject.</em></p>

<p>We can write the sum of squares error in matrix form as</p>

\[E(f(\phi(x), w) = (y - \phi w)^T(y - \phi w)\]

<p>You might have noticed that we used \(\phi\) instead of \(\phi(x)\). We will 
abuse the notations to make the further mathematical treatment simple to 
understand.</p>

<p>Then we can find the parameters \(\hat{w}\)</p>

\[\hat{w} = \underset{w}{(y - \phi w)^T(y - \phi w)}\]

<p>Differentiating \(E\) with respect to \(w\),</p>

\[\frac{\partial{E}}{\partial{w}} = -2 \phi^T (y - \phi w)\]

\[\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial{w}\partial{w^T}} = \phi^T \phi\]

<p>If \(\phi\) has full column rank, and hence \(\phi^T \phi\) is positive 
definite, we set the first derivative to zero</p>

\[\phi^T (y - \phi w) = 0\]

<p>To obtain the solution</p>

\[\hat{w} = (\phi^T \phi)^{-1} \phi^T y\]
<h2><a name="ch10-GeometricInterpretationofLeastSquaresSolution"></a>Geometric Interpretation of Least Squares Solution</h2>
      <p><img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/geometric_interpretation.svg" alt="Geometric interpretation of least squares solution" /></p>

<p>In the above figure, the \(\phi_1(x)\), \(\phi_2(x)\), …, \(\phi_p(x)\) are 
the vectors corresponding to each column of \(\phi(x)\). The shaded blue 
region is the hyperplane which contains the vectors \(\phi_1(x)\), 
\(\phi_2(x)\), …, \(\phi_p(x)\). In other words, the shaded blue region is 
the column space of \(\phi(x)\).</p>

<p>The predicted values \(\hat{y}\) are given by</p>

\[\hat{y} = \phi \hat{w}\]

<p>\(\hat{y}\) is a linear combination of columns of \(\phi\), hence \(\hat{y}\) 
lies in the same hyperplane as \(\phi_1(x)\), \(\phi_2(x)\), …, 
\(\phi_p(x)\).</p>

<p>\(y - \hat{y}\) is the vector difference of the estimated values 
\(\hat{y}_i\)’s and the actual observations \(y_i\)’s. The maginitude of this 
vector is given by</p>

\[\lvert y - \hat{y} \rvert = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\]

<p>The maginitude of \(y - \hat{y}\) is same as the sum of squared error. This 
maginitude will be minimum when the vector \(y - \hat{y}\) is perpendicular to 
the hyperplane containing \(\phi_1(x)\), \(\phi_2(x)\), …, \(\phi_p(x)\). In 
other words, the error will be minimum when \((y - \hat{y}) \perp \phi_1(x)\), 
\((y - \hat{y}) \perp \phi_2(x)\), …, \((y - \hat{y}) \perp \phi_p(x)\). 
This can be exressed in terms of dot product as:</p>

\[(y - \hat{y})^T \phi_1(x)\\
(y - \hat{y})^T \phi_2(x)\\
. \\
. \\
. \\
(y - \hat{y})^T \phi_p(x)\\\]

<p>In matrix form,</p>

\[(y - \hat{y})^T \phi = \bar{0}\]

<p>Substituting value of \(\hat{y}\),</p>

\[(y - \phi \hat{w})^T \phi = (\bar{0})^T\\
y^T \phi - \hat{w}^T \phi^T \phi = (\bar{0})^T\\
\phi^T y - \phi^T \phi \hat{w} = \bar{0}\\
\phi^T \phi \hat{w} = \phi^T y\]

<p>Thus,</p>

\[\hat{w} = (\phi^T \phi)^{-1} \phi^T y\]

<p>This is same result which we obtained earlier.</p>

<p>It is important to note that \(\phi^T \phi\) is invertible only when \(\phi\) 
has full column rank.</p>
<h2><a name="ch10-MatrixRank"></a>Matrix Rank</h2>
      <p>A \(m \times n\) matrix has \(m\) rows, each containing \(n\) elements each. 
Same matrix can also be viewed as \(n\) columns containing \(m\) elements each.</p>

<p>The rank of a matrix is defined as maximum number of linearly independent rows 
or columns of a matrix.</p>

<p>Here, a row \(r_i\) is said to be linearly independent if it cannot be 
obtained by a linear combination of any other rows. Linear combination is an 
operation like \(a_1 r_1 + a_2 + r_2 + ...\) where \(a_j\)’s are scalar 
constants. In other words, \(r_i\) is linearly independent if</p>

\[r_i \neq \sum_{j \neq i}^{} a_j r_j\]

<p>for any values of \(a_1\), \(a_2\), …,\(a_{i-1}\), \(a_{i+1}\), …</p>

<p>Same goes for columns as well. A column \(c_i\) is said to be linearly 
independent if it cannot be obtained by a linear combination of any other 
columns.</p>

<p>For an \(m \times n\) matrix,</p>
<ul>
  <li>If \(m \lt n\), then the maximum rank of the matrix is \(m\).</li>
  <li>If \(m \gt n\), then the maximum rank of the matrix is \(n\).
The rank of a matrix would be zero only if the matrix had no elements. If a 
matrix had even one element, its minimum rank would be one.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="finding-rank-of-a-matrix">Finding rank of a matrix</h3>
<p>To find rank of a matrix, first convert it to an upper or lower traiangular 
form using elementary row operations e.g \(r_1 \Leftarrow 2 r_3 + 5 r_6\). 
<em>(More formally, we should convert the matrix to its row echelon form. But for 
finding rank, any triangular form works just as good)</em>. You might not get a 
perfect triangle always, thats ok, you should strive to get as many rows 
containing all zeros as possible. Then, the rank of the matrix is equal to the 
number of non zero rows in the transformed matrix.</p>

<p>For example,</p>

\[\begin{bmatrix}
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
2 &amp; 7 &amp; 8
\end{bmatrix}
\Longrightarrow
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 2 &amp; 1\\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 2\\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Hence, rank of this matrix is 2.</p>

<p>We could also use elementary column operations to transform columns instead of 
rows. The rank will remain the same.</p>

<h3 id="full-rank-matrices">Full rank matrices</h3>
<p>A matrix is called full rank matrix if all the vectors in a matrix are 
linearly independent. For example,</p>

\[A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\
2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\
3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>\(A\) is a full rank matrix.</p>

<p>Following are some interesting conclusions that can be drawn by looking at the 
rank of a matrix:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The determinant of a square matrix is zero if it is not full column rank.</li>
  <li>A square matrix is invertible only if it has full rank. Because, otherwise

<p>We can have full column rank or full row rank matrices for non-square matrices 
i.e. when \(m \neq n\).</p>

<p>A matrix is called full column rank matrix if all the column vectors in a 
matrix are linearly independent i.e. rank of matrix is equal to the number of 
columns. For example,</p>

\[B = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0\\
2 &amp; 1\\
3 &amp; 2
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>\(B\) is full column rank matrix because \(Rank(B) = 2 = number \; of \; 
columns \; of \; B\)</p>

<p>A matrix is called full row rank matrix if all the row vectors in a matrix are 
linearly independent i.e. rank of matrix is equal to the number of rows. For 
example,</p>

\[C = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 2\\
9 &amp; 6 &amp; 3
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>\(C\) is full column rank matrix because \(Rank(C) = 2 = number \; of \; rows 
\; of \; C\)</p>

<h3 id="column-space">Column space</h3>
<p>Column space of a matrix is the set of all possible vectors that can be 
obtained by linear combination of columns of the matrix. Column space 
\(\mathcal(C)\) of a \(m \times n\) matrix \(\phi = [ \phi_1 \; \phi_2 \; ... 
\;\phi_n ]\) where \(\phi_i\)]s are the columns of \(\phi\) is given as</p>

\[\mathcal{C}(\phi) = \{ x \mid x = w^T \phi \; \forall \; w \in 
\mathbb{R}^m\}\]

<p>Geometrically, column space is the plane containing \(\phi_1\), \(\phi_2\), 
…, \(\phi_n\).</p>

<h3 id="lemma">Lemma</h3>
<p>A matrix \(\phi^T \phi\) is invertible if and only if \(\phi\) is full column 
rank.</p>

<p><strong>Proof:</strong></p>

<p><em>Part 1:</em></p>

<p>Lets assume that \(\phi\) is not full column rank.</p>

<p>Then, it means that there exists a vector \(x\) such that \(x \neq \bar{0}\) 
and</p>

\[\phi x = \bar{0}\]

<p>Pre-multiplying both sides by \(\phi^T\),</p>

\[\phi^T \phi x = \bar{0}\]

<p>Thus, the matrix \(\phi^T \phi\) is not full rank and hence not invertible.</p>

<p><em>Part 2:</em></p>

<p>Lets assume that \(\phi\) is full column rank and \(\phi^T \phi\) is non 
invertible.</p>

<p>Then, it means that there exists a vector \(x\) such that \(x \neq \bar{0}\) 
and</p>

\[\phi^T \phi x = \bar{0}\]

<p>Pre-multiplying both sides by \(x^T\),</p>

\[x^T \phi^T \phi x = 0\\
(\phi x)^T \phi x = 0\\
\phi x = \bar{0}\]

<p>Thus, the matrix \(\phi\) is not full column rank. Our assumption is 
incorrect. \(\phi^T \phi\) must be invertible.</p>
<h2><a name="ch10-MaximumLikelihoodEstimate"></a>Maximum Likelihood Estimate</h2>
      <p>Suresh tosses a coin 1000 times and he observes heads 400 times.</p>

<p>This is a stochastic process that takes discrete values viz. heads (1) or tails 
(0). In such cases, we can calculate the probability of observing a particular 
set of outcomes by making suitable assumptions about the underlying stochastic 
process. For example, in our case, probability of coin landing heads is \(p\) 
and that coin tosses are independent.</p>

<p>Let’s denote the observed outcomes by \(O\) and the set of parameters that 
describe the stochastic process as \(\theta\). Our observed outcome is 400 
heads and 600 tails. The process of tossing a coin is governed only by the 
probability \(p\). Hence, \(\theta = p\). Thus, when we speak of probability 
we want to calculate \(P(O \mid \theta)\). In other words, given specific 
values for \(\theta\), \(P(O \mid \theta)\) is the probability that we would 
observe the outcomes represented by \(O\).</p>

<p>However, when we model a real life stochastic process, we often do not know 
\(\theta\). We simply observe \(O\) and the goal then is to arrive at an 
estimate for \(\theta\) that would be a plausible choice given the observed 
outcomes \(O\). We know that given a value of \(\theta\) the probability of 
observing \(O\) is \(P(O \mid \theta)\). Thus, a ‘natural’ estimation process 
is to choose that value of \(\theta\) that would maximize the probability that 
we would actually observe \(O\). In other words, we find the parameter values 
\(\theta\) that maximize the following function:</p>

\[L(\theta \mid O) = P(O \mid \theta)\]

<p>\(L(\theta \mid O)\) is called the likelihood function. Notice that by 
definition the likelihood function is conditioned on the observed \(O\) and 
that it is a function of the unknown parameters \(\theta\).</p>

<p>Suresh is about to toss the coin again and he would like to know the 
probability of getting a heads in this toss. We can estimate the probability 
of observing heads as</p>

\[P(Heads) = \frac{400}{1000} = 0.4 = \hat{p}_{MLE}\]

<p>However, it is important to note that we do not know the exact probability of 
getting the heads \(p\). \(\hat{p}_{MLE}\) is an estimate that maximises the 
likelihood of observing the outcomes that we already saw. In other words, it 
the value of the parameter which is the most reasonable explantion for our 
observations.</p>

<h3 id="caveat-continuous-random-variables">Caveat: Continuous Random Variables</h3>

<p>If the stochatistc process has a continous random variable as its outcome, 
then the situation is similar with one important difference. We can no longer 
talk about the probability that we observed \(O\) given \(\theta\) because in 
the continuous case \(P(O \mid \theta)=0\). Without getting into technicalities
, the basic idea is as follows:</p>

<p>Denote the probability density function (pdf) associated with the outcomes 
\(O\) as: \(f(O \mid \theta)\). Thus, in the continuous case we estimate 
\(\theta\) given observed outcomes \(O\) by maximizing the following function:</p>

\[L(\theta \mid O)=f(O \mid \theta)\]

<p>Our use of the pdf instead of actual probability intutuively makes sense 
because if we compare probabilities of getting a small set of outcome e.g. 
\(P(300 \leq O \leq 301 \mid \theta)\) instead of a particular outcome e.g. 
\(P(O = 300 \mid \theta)\), then we can see that the probabilities are 
actually proportional to the value of pdf 
\(f((O_{max} + O_{min})/2 \mid \theta)\).</p>

<p>In this situation, we cannot technically assert that we are finding the 
parameter value that maximizes the probability that we observe \(O\) as we 
maximize the PDF associated with the observed outcomes \(O\).</p>
