</header>
<div class="content">
  <p>Linear regression is concerned with modelling the relationship between 
dependent variable and independent variable.</p>

<p>Suppose a company would like to know how much it should spend on the 
commercials to achieve a certain amount of sales. It has the data regarding 
their previous investments for commercials and the resultant sales figures. To 
get a somewhat accurate estimate, the analysts in the company would like to 
understand the reationship between the sales and the investments into the TV 
commercials.</p>

<p>Let’s establish the following notation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The amount invested into the TV commercials is denoted by \(x\) because it 
is the independent variable here.</li>
  <li>The sales figure during this period is denoted by \(y\) because it is the 
dependent variable.</li>
  <li>The company has data in form of n pairs like \((x_i, y_i)\) where \(i\) is 
the index.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s visualize the data via a scatter plot
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/linear-regression1.png" alt="Scatter Plot: Sales vs TV" />
We can clearly see a linear trend in this plot. If spending on TV commercials 
increases the sales figures seem to increase.</p>

<p>We describe a general linear relationship between \(x\) and \(y\) via the 
following equation:</p>

\[y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x\]

<p>If we fit the this curve to the data, we get the following line:</p>

\[y = 6.9748 + 0.0554x\]

<p>Let’s plot this line on our data
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/linear-regression2.png" alt="Linear Regression Fit" />
We can see that the line passes more or less through the middle of the data 
points.</p>

<p>You can refer the <a href="https://github.com/akshaykhadse/DigitalCognitionBook/blob/code/01_linear_regression/01_linear_regression.ipynb">linear regression notebook</a> for complete example.</p>

<p>In this example, we had just one value as input i.e. the \(x\) was scalar. 
However, there might be seveal factors which influence the sales figures like</p>
<ul>
  <li>Time of investment</li>
  <li>Time of commercial</li>
  <li>Expenditure on radio commercials</li>
  <li>Expenditure on newspaper commercials</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case, the \(x\) is not a scalar, but a collection of the above 
attributes. The following section will formalize the linear regression problem 
for such cases.</p>
<h2><a name="pt3ch1-SimpleLinearRegression"></a>Simple Linear Regression</h2>
        <p>Suppose we have a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) which contains examples 
\((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), \((x_3, y_3)\), … \((x_n, y_n)\) where \(m\) 
is the total number of examples.</p>

<p>Each \(x\) is an input (also known as independent variable). And each \(y\) is 
output (also known as dependent or target variable).</p>

<p>\((x, y)\) represents a single example. \((x_i, y_i)\) is the \(j^{th}\) 
example where \(j\) is index to the dataset.</p>

<p>Each \(x_i\) has \(p\) attributes \(\phi_1(x_i)\), \(\phi_2(x_i)\), …, 
\(\phi_p(x_i)\). \(\phi_i\)’s should be considered as a functions which when 
applied to any point \(x_j\), gives the value of attribute \(\phi_i(x_j)\). 
For example, we may encounter a sample \((1.12, 14)\) where \(x_i = 10\). If 
an attribute is defined as \(\phi_j(x_i) = sin(x_i)\), then 
$$\phi_j(1.12) = sin(1.12).</p>

<p>We define a new \(n \times (p+1)\) matrix \(\phi(x)\) or simply \(\phi\) as</p>

\[\phi = 
\begin{bmatrix}
1 &amp; \phi_1(x_1) &amp; \phi_2(x_1) &amp; ... &amp; \phi_p(x_1)\\
1 &amp; \phi_1(x_2) &amp; \phi_2(x_2) &amp; ... &amp; \phi_p(x_2)\\
.\\
.\\
.\\
1 &amp; \phi_1(x_n) &amp; \phi_2(x_n) &amp; ... &amp; \phi_p(x_n)\\
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>\(i^{th}\) row of this matrix is represented as \(\phi(x_i)\). Similarly, 
\(i^{th}\) column of this matrix can be represented as \(\phi_i(x)\). This is 
also known as \(i^{th}\) feature of the datset \(\mathcal{D}\).</p>

<p>Let’s also define a \(n \times 1\) matrix \(y\) as</p>

\[y = 
\begin{bmatrix}
y_1 \\
y_2 \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
y_n
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>The general equation of linear regression model is</p>

\[y_i = w_0 + w_1 \phi_1(x_i) + w_2 \phi_2(x_i) + ... + w_p \phi_p(x_i)\]

<p>where \(w_0\) is the bias and \(w_1\), \(w_2\), …, \(w_p\) are weights. We 
can denote this by a vector \(w\) as</p>

\[w = 
\begin{bmatrix}
w_0 \\
w_1 \\
w_2 \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
w_p
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>Then the above equation in the matrix form can be written as</p>

\[y_i = w_1 ^ T \phi(x_i)\]

<p>where</p>

\[\phi(x_i) =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
\phi_1(x_i) \\
\phi_2(x_i) \\
. \\
. \\
. \\
\phi_p(x_i)
\end{bmatrix}\]

<p>The same equation can be written for all values of \(y\) as</p>

\[y = \phi(x) w\]

<p>The \(y\) is linear combination of columns of matrix \(\phi\) because 
\(i^{th}\) column of \(\phi\) is multiplied by \(w_i\). But this does not mean 
that linear regression is naievely linear. We can inject nonlinearities via 
the features/basis functions \(\phi_i\)s. For example, we could have used a 
function \(\phi(x_i) = x_i^2\) in the TV commercial example. To summarize, 
\(y\) is linear in \(\phi\) and \(w\) but it may or may not be linear with 
respect to \(x\).</p>

<h3 id="regression-problem">Regression Problem</h3>
<p>Now we define the regression problem as:</p>

<p>Determine a function \(\hat{f}\) such that \(\hat{f}(x)\) is the best predictor 
(minimizes the error \(E(f, \mathcal{D})\)) of \(y\) with respect to the data 
\(\mathcal{D}\).</p>

\[\hat{f} = \underset{f \in \mathcal{F}}{\operatorname{argmin}} E(f, \mathcal{D})\]

<p>Here, \(f\) is a function which belongs to a class of functions 
\(\mathcal{F}\). For linear regression, \(\mathcal{F}\) is class of linear 
functions i.e. \(f\) is a linear function.</p>

<p>When we say best predictor, we must have a measure which we use to determine 
goodness of a function. The error function \(E\) is a measure of deviation of 
predicted value \(\hat{y}\) from the observed value \(y\). Smaller the error, 
better the predictior function \(f\). The error \(E\) is a function of \(f\) 
and data \(\mathcal{D}\). A common error function is Sum of Squared Error. 
There are different types of linear regression based on what error function is 
minimized and what classes of fuctions are considered.</p>

<h3 id="linear-regression-problem">Linear Regression Problem</h3>
<p>If we consider the class of linear functions for \(f\), then 
\(f(\phi(x), w) = \phi(x)w\). We can rewrite the above problem as:</p>

<p>Determine parameters \(w\) for the function \(f(\phi(x), w)\) which minimises 
the error function \(E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\).</p>

\[\hat{w} = \underset{w}{\operatorname{argmin}} E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\]

<h3 id="sum-of-squared-error-sse">Sum of Squared Error (SSE)</h3>
<p>The sum of squares error is defined as follows:</p>

\[E(f, \mathcal{D}) = \sum_{\mathcal{D}}^{} (y_i - f(x_i))^2\]

<p>It measures the square of deviation of each example \((x_i, y_i)\) from the 
prediction \(\hat{y_i} = w^\intercal \phi(x_i)\). Thus, it is a function of \(f\) and 
data \(\mathcal{D}\). This also known as Residual Sum of Squares (RSS).</p>

<p>This error is used to find a least square solution to linear regression 
problem.</p>
<h2><a name="pt3ch1-LeastSquaresSolution"></a>Least Squares Solution</h2>
        <p><em>The following discussion relies on matrix calculus. If you are not comfortable 
with matrix calculus, you may want to take a look at 
<a href="https://atmos.washington.edu/~dennis/MatrixCalculus.pdf">this article</a> on the 
subject.</em></p>

<p>We can write the sum of squares error in matrix form as</p>

\[E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D}) = (y - \phi w)^\intercal(y - \phi w)\]

<p>You might have noticed that we used \(\phi\) instead of \(\phi(x)\). We will 
abuse the notations to make the further mathematical treatment simple to 
understand.</p>

<p>Then we can find the parameters \(\hat{w}\)</p>

\[\hat{w} = \underset{w}{(y - \phi w)^\intercal(y - \phi w)}\]

<p>Differentiating \(E\) with respect to \(w\),</p>

\[\frac{\partial{E}}{\partial{w}} = -2 \phi^\intercal (y - \phi w)\]

\[\frac{\partial^2 E}{\partial{w}\partial{w^\intercal}} = \phi^\intercal \phi\]

<p>If \(\phi\) has full column rank, \(\phi^\intercal \phi\) is positive definite, we set 
the first derivative to zero</p>

\[\phi^\intercal (y - \phi w) = 0\]

<p>To obtain the solution</p>

\[\hat{w} = (\phi^\intercal \phi)^{-1} \phi^\intercal y\]
<h2><a name="pt3ch1-GeometricInterpretationofLeastSquaresSolution"></a>Geometric Interpretation of Least Squares Solution</h2>
        <p><img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/geometric_interpretation.svg" alt="Geometric interpretation of least squares solution" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>

<p>In the above figure, the \(\phi_1(x)\), \(\phi_2(x)\), …, \(\phi_p(x)\) are 
the vectors corresponding to each column of \(\phi(x)\). The shaded blue 
region is the hyperplane which contains the vectors \(\phi_1(x)\), 
\(\phi_2(x)\), …, \(\phi_p(x)\). In other words, the shaded blue region is 
the column space of \(\phi(x)\).</p>

<p>The predicted values \(\hat{y}\) are given by</p>

\[\hat{y} = \phi \hat{w}\]

<p>\(\hat{y}\) is a linear combination of columns of \(\phi\), hence \(\hat{y}\) 
lies in the same hyperplane as \(\phi_1(x)\), \(\phi_2(x)\), …, 
\(\phi_p(x)\).</p>

<p>\(y - \hat{y}\) is the vector difference of the estimated values 
\(\hat{y}_i\)’s and the actual observations \(y_i\)’s. The maginitude of this 
vector is given by</p>

\[\lvert y - \hat{y} \rvert = \sum_{i = 1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2\]

<p>The maginitude of \(y - \hat{y}\) is same as the sum of squared error. This 
maginitude will be minimum when the vector \(y - \hat{y}\) is perpendicular to 
the hyperplane containing \(\phi_1(x)\), \(\phi_2(x)\), …, \(\phi_p(x)\). In 
other words, the error will be minimum when \((y - \hat{y}) \perp \phi_1(x)\), 
\((y - \hat{y}) \perp \phi_2(x)\), …, \((y - \hat{y}) \perp \phi_p(x)\). 
This can be exressed in terms of dot product as:</p>

\[(y - \hat{y})^\intercal \phi_1(x)\\
(y - \hat{y})^\intercal \phi_2(x)\\
. \\
. \\
. \\
(y - \hat{y})^\intercal \phi_p(x)\\\]

<p>In matrix form,</p>

\[(y - \hat{y})^\intercal \phi = \bar{0}\]

<p>Substituting value of \(\hat{y}\),</p>

\[(y - \phi \hat{w})^\intercal \phi = (\bar{0})^\intercal\\
y^\intercal \phi - \hat{w}^\intercal \phi^\intercal \phi = (\bar{0})^\intercal\\
\phi^\intercal y - \phi^\intercal \phi \hat{w} = \bar{0}\\
\phi^\intercal \phi \hat{w} = \phi^\intercal y\]

<p>Thus,</p>

\[\hat{w} = (\phi^\intercal \phi)^{-1} \phi^\intercal y\]

<p>This is same result which we obtained earlier.</p>

<p>It is important to note that \(\phi^\intercal \phi\) is invertible only when \(\phi\) 
has full column rank.</p>
<h2><a name="pt3ch1-ProbabilisticInterpretation"></a>Probabilistic Interpretation</h2>
        <p>From the discussion so far, we know that \(y\) is a function of \(\phi(x)\). 
But, this function is only approximate, in the sense that it does not give us 
the exact value of \(y_i\)’s. We can see in the TV commercials example that 
the deviations \(y_1-\hat{y_1}\), \(y_2-\hat{y_2}\), …, \(y_n-\hat{y_n}\) 
appear to be random i.e. they do not seem to follow any relation. Let’s denote 
this deviation by \(\varepsilon_1\), \(\varepsilon_1\), \(\varepsilon_2\), 
…, \(\varepsilon_n\). Then, it is reasonable to assume that each 
\(\varepsilon_i\) is a random variable which follows a Gaussian distribution 
with mean 0 and variance \(\sigma^2\) denoted as \(\mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2)\). 
Then,</p>

\[y_i - \hat{y_i} = \varepsilon_i\\
y_i = \hat{y_i} + \varepsilon_i\\
y_i = w^\intercal \phi(x_i) + \varepsilon_i\]

<p>This means that each \(y_i\) follows a Gaussian distribution with mean 
\(\mu = w^\intercal \phi(x_i)\) and variance \(\sigma^2\). This can be denoted 
as \(y_i ~ \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\). Thus, we can describe this 
observation as the following probabilistic model</p>

\[\begin{align}
P(y_i|w, x_j, \sigma^2) &amp;= \mathcal{N}(w^\intercal \phi(x_i), \sigma^2)\\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{y_i-w^\intercal\phi(x_i)}{\sigma})^2}
\end{align}\]

<p>\(y\) is a vector of elements \(y_1\), \(y_2\), …, \(y_n\). Moreover, in the 
dataset \(\mathcal{D}\), picking a sample \((x_i, y_i)\) from the population 
does not affect the chances of any other point ending up in the dataset. In 
other words, \(y_1\), \(y_2\), …, \(y_n\) are independent random valiables. 
Since, each \(y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2)\), they are indentically 
distributed. Thus,</p>

\[P(y|w, x, \sigma^2) = \prod_{i = 1}^{n} P(y_i|w, x_j, \sigma^2)\]

<p>and</p>

\[\mathbb{E}(y(w, x)) = \phi(x) w\]

<p>We can formulate the regression problem as:<br />
Given the dataset \(\mathcal{D}\), find the most likelihood estimate 
\(\hat{w}_{\tiny{MLE}}\). In other words, find an estimate 
\(\hat{w}_{\tiny{MLE}}\) which is most likely to produce the \(y\) that we 
observed in \(\mathcal{D}\).</p>

<p>The likelihood of observing data \(\mathcal{D}\) is denoted by 
\(L(w \mid \mathcal{D})\). It is give as</p>

\[\begin{align}
L(w \mid \mathcal{D}) &amp;= P(\mathcal{D} \mid w)\\
&amp;= P(y \mid x, w, \sigma^2)
&amp;= \prod_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{y_i-w^\intercal\phi(x_i)}{\sigma})^2}
\end{align}\]

<p>Quite tedious expression, huh? Let’s take natural logs of both sides</p>

\[\begin{align}
\ln(L(w \mid \mathcal{D})) &amp;= \ln(\prod_{i = 1}^{n} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma} e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{y_i-w^\intercal\phi(x_i)}{\sigma})^2})\\
LL(w \mid \mathcal{D}) &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{n} \left( ln \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi}\sigma} \right) -\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{y_i-w^\intercal\phi(x_i)}{\sigma} \right)^2 \right)\\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^{n} ln \left( \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}} \right) - \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} (y_i-w^\intercal\phi(x_i))^2\\
&amp;= -\frac{n}{2} ln(2 \pi \sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-w^\intercal\phi(x_i))^2
\end{align}\]

<p>\(LL(w \mid \mathcal{D})\) is called the log likelihood function. Since log is 
a monotonically increasing function, it preserves the location of maximums and 
minimums when log is used a transform. Hence, maximizing 
\(L(w \mid \mathcal{D})\) is equivalent to maximizing 
\(LL(w \mid \mathcal{D})\). Maximizing log likelihood function instead of 
likelihood function is known as the log optimization trick. The log likelihood 
function can also be expressed in terms of sum of squares error 
\(E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\) as</p>

\[\begin{align}
LL(w \mid \mathcal{D}) &amp;= -\frac{n}{2} ln(2 \pi \sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i-w^\intercal\phi(x_i))^2\\
&amp;= -\frac{n}{2} ln(2 \pi \sigma^2) - \frac{1}{2 \sigma^2} E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})
\end{align}\]

<p>Thus, maximizing \(LL(w \mid \mathcal{D})\) is equivalent to minimizing 
\(E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\) since 
\(LL(w \mid \mathcal{D}) = - c_1 E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D}) + c_2\). 
Therefore, maximizing likelihood function \(L(w \mid \mathcal{D})\) is 
equivalent to minimizing the sum of squares error 
\(E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\).</p>

<p>The maximum likelihood estimator is given by</p>

\[\hat{w}_{\tiny{MLE}} = \underset{w}{\operatorname{argmax}} P(\mathcal{D} \mid w)\]

<p>This can be formulated as a minimization problem</p>

\[\hat{w}_{\tiny{MLE}} = \underset{w}{\operatorname{argmin}} E(f(\phi(x), w), \mathcal{D})\]

<p>This is the same minimization problem that we solved for getting the least 
squares solution. Hence, finding maximum likelihood estimator is same as the 
least squares solution of the linear regression problem. Therefore, most 
likelihood estimate is</p>

\[\hat{w}_{\tiny{MLE}} = (\phi^\intercal \phi)^{-1} \phi^\intercal y\]
<h2><a name="pt3ch1-Overfitting"></a>Overfitting</h2>
        <p>Consider the TV commercial example taht we saw while begininning this chapter. 
You might have noticed that we conviniently avoided the question, “Why did we 
chose to fit a line?”. We could have used some other polynomial of degree 
\(n\). Let’s address this with a different example. You can find the source 
code for the example that we are about to discuss 
<a href="https://github.com/akshaykhadse/DigitalCognitionBook/blob/code/01_linear_regression/02_overfitting.ipynb">here</a>.</p>

<p>We begin by generating some data. To mimic sort of real-world data, we will 
generate a sine wave \(y = \sin(1.2 \pi x)\) and then add a random noise to 
this signal. We generate 120 such samples. The following figure shows all 
these points against the true sine curve. 
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/overfitting_data.png" alt="" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>

<p>Next, we reserve 30% of those samples for testing our model while we use rest 
of the samples for training a polynomial model. Let’s fit a ploynomial with 
degrees 5 and 25.
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/overfitting_polynomial.png" alt="" width="80%" height="80%" />
You can observe that the ploynomial of degree 5 (shown in blue) is smoother 
than polynomial with degree 25 (shown in orange). The degree 5 polynomial does 
not pass through each and every point, it just manages to stay in between the 
points. The 25 degree polynomial is not smooth, however, it passes through 
some of the points points especially towards the end of the curve. If we 
choose a degree high enough, we can find a polynoial which passes through each 
point. For example, see the following:
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/overfitted_curve.png" alt="" width="80%" height="80%" /></p>

<p>But what happens to errors for different polynomial models? Well, let’s plot 
these
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/overfitting_errors.png" alt="" width="80%" height="80%" />
Observe that the train error and test error both decrease upto polynomial 
model of degree 5. The test error is minimum for this polynomial. If we fit 
polynomial models with higher degrees, then the train error keeps on 
decreasing. However, the test error starts to increase. This means that the 
training process is begining to give us models that fail to generalise well 
on unseen data. In other words, the training algorithm is focussing on fitting 
all training points on the curve instead of finding a curve that generalises 
the behavior over new data. This is called overfitting. It should be noted 
that, the aim of training algorithm should not be to give a model that has 0% 
error. It should concerntrate on finding a sweet spot where both train and 
test errors are small enough. Thus, we should keep on increasing the model 
complexity until both the train and test errors decrease. (In this case, 
degree of polynomial represents the model complexity. More the degree of 
polynomial, greater the model complexity). We should stop when the test error 
starts increasing and choose a model which results in minimum test error.</p>

<p>While we’re on the subject, let’s take a look at what happens to the 
magintudes of the weights of our predicted model. We plot the maginitude (also 
known as \(\mathcal{L}_2\) norm) of vector \(w\) against the degree of 
polynomial
<img src="/DigitalCognitionBook/assets/images/overfitting_weights.png" alt="" width="80%" height="80%" />
You can see that, as we increase the model complexity, the magnitude of 
weights goes on increasing. Thus, if we want the model complexity to not 
increase unnecessarily (to prevent overfitting), we should limit the magintude 
of weights. This restriction or shrinking of the model weights is called as 
regularization.</p>
